# FanWoolf
Top Down 1941 style demo shooter game made with C# and XNA, artwork by Courtney Tucker, exported to XBox 360
Demo game made as a final senior project (two quarters long) at Art Institute San Diego, submitted Spring 2012.

## My Source Code and Completed Project Folders

This project spans two folders, one for the source, and the other the resulting installable for MS Windows machines.
To install the completed project, copy the two files and the "Application Files" subfolder into where you want to install, then run the "Setup" executable.
The "All Menu Interface Version Debug" folder is where I did my development.

### Installation Prerequisites

This executable does not run on Apple laptops natively, but if you have software that lets you run a Windows process environment window, then you could be able to install this game.
While installing, the operating system of your computer may throw up a warning of installing a program from "an unknown publisher".  That "publisher" is me, so just accept the warning and move on. 

If you have an XBox joystick, you can plug that into one of your USB ports, to enhance your gameplay experience.
